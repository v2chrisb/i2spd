Week-3b: Compound.  Important notes to self go here at the top. 

**===== 11/4 morning session; start @ 0533, finish @ 0629**

Read-up again on MouseEvent. I need to understand how the documentation 
explains, and how to use, the procdures and syntax.

Started to write a scenario on paper and from this exercise noticed that I had
a misconception about how the program worked. I initially thought that the x y
coordinates would be display when the user *clicked* a location on the empty
scene, but that is wrong. The coordinates are constantly displayed as soon as
the mouse cursor enters the empty scene.

**===== 11/3 morning session; start @ 0625, finish @ 0737**

Changed structure name from mpoint to mouse-position for clarity purposes.

Reviewing Compound Structures chapter in the HtDP online book.

When I get to the functions section of the program and see WS -> WS, I'm not
confident about how to put everything together.

I think I finally put together the off-line version of the course in a format
that makes sense and can be used.

Starting to look at the solution and right away, two things jump out:

+ I didn't define constants for the TEXT that has to be displayed
+ my constant definitions were random
  => the Prof. had two examples: one for upper-left & one for lower-right
  => upper-left = 0 0
  => lower right = WIDTH HEIGHT
  
Nung-Poo is awake...

**===== 11/2 evening session; start @ 2257, finish @ 2311**

Clocks back an hour tonight! Late for study, but must study! :-)

You've read the docs for a couple of days, now let's get back to that mouse
tracker program.

The problem states, "Design a world program that displays the current (x, y)
position of the mouse at that current position: as the mouse moves, the 
numbers in the (x, y) display changes and its position changes."

Back to the TeachPacks documentation, section 2.4.3, Interactions.

**===== 11/1 morning session; start @ 0555, finish @ 0629**

All Saints! Thanks be to God for His Saints, especially Mary, Queen of Saints!

Up late, but it's really (kind of) OK because I did spend time yesterday after-
noon reading/scanning section 2.4 in the teachpack documentation and even
tried the UFO example function. I learned that the only mandatory clause of a
big-bang description is to-draw -- I recall unknowingly struggling with this
recently.

A teachpack extends the set of procedures that are built into a language in
DrRacket. For example, a teachpack might extend the Beginning Student language
with a procedure for playing sounds.

A tool extends the set of utilities within the DrRacket environment. For
example, DrRacket’s Check Syntax button starts a syntax-checking tool.

Done exploring documentation for this morning. I'm not going to commit right now
*because* I want to be sure I do work this evening. Back to the examples in the
prologue.

**===== 10/31 morning session; start @ 0501, finish @ 0625**

Reading in Randolph didn't happen so this morning is yet more reading (starting
in the prologue in section 1.2).

Notice: the function used for the rocket example -- y = x * x -- has the rocket
DESCENDING because y ccordinates are measured DOWNWARDS, not upwards.

Point from the notes: functions provide a rather economic way of computing lots
of interesting values with a single expression. Indeed, programs are functions,
and once you understand functions well, you know almost everything there is
about programming.

(define (FunctionName InputName) BodyExpression)

Above is a function definition - the keyword 'define' distinguishes it from an
expression. A function definition consists of three pieces: two names and an
expression.

(FunctionName ArgumentExpression)

Above is a function application. The first part tells Dr. Racket which function
you wish to use. The second part is the input to which you wish to apply the
function.

Now consider (define (FunctionName InputName) BodyExpression) using these:

(define (y x) (* x x ))  ; the first example

Here the FunctionName is y; the InputName is x; BodyExpression is (* x x).

Now a little more complex...

(define (create-rocket-scene height)
    (place-image <rocket pic> 50 height (empty-scene 100 100)))

FunctionName is create-rocket-scene.
InputName is height.
BodyExpression is (place-image <rocket pic> 50 height (empty-scene 100 100)))

Here the 50 is the x coord. If you change it to say, 25, the rocket moves to the
left in the scene. Height is the y coord -- the smaller the number, the closer
the rocket will be to the top of the scene.

Getting time to sign-off. You sent yourself an e-mail about this topic so you
can look at it throughout the day. It's really important that you have a solid
understanding about this subject matter. You need to be confident with it, too.

**===== 10/30 morning session; start @ 0533, finish @ 0627**

Had to sleep a little more this morning. Watched a fascinating presentation
about Coq last night (forwarded to me by Peter).

For the first time yesterday I made my first real contact with the Dr. Racket
documentation, which is "both bogus and sad" but, whatever. The lesson here is
that if you are going to learn to program then it will be very important and you
will spend a good amount of time reading a variety of documentation. That said,
I'm starting this morning by reading the HtDP2e prologue. Another section that
seems to have content I should consider reading is TeachPack -- "Worlds and the
Universe: universe.rkt". This immediately referred me to the prologue, which I'm
now reading.

Notes from reading:

+ a primitive is also called a built-in
+ to compute is to determine the value of expressions
+ values can be numbers, strings and even images in BSL

The notation you learned in school is utterly misleading, i.e. y = x * x

(define (y x) (* x x ))

The define says "consider y a function". Seeing this made my understanding of
what a function is in Dr. Racket a little more concrete today. It's good that
I'm stopping to do some reading. Signing-off for now but hope to find some time
in Randolph to do some reading, too.

**===== 10/29 morning session; start @ 0448, finish @ 0617**

Keep going. Yesterday during work and in the evening you had some thoughts
about this mouse tracking program:

+ a mouse click is an event that can trigger something
+ the trigger can be used to capture input
+ the input captured will be the mouse (x,y) coord.
+ these instantaneous (x,y) coord's will become the program output

Good, now get a piece of paper and map-out your program (but get your coffee
first).

0500: Philippines (Bunsoy) called. Lolo Shano passed away. I'll always recall
him as a kind and gentle man. God bless you, Lolo. May your soul rest in the 
peace of our Lord and King, Jesus Christ. Blessed Mother, please pray for Lolo.

Thinking about what numeric type to use I finally found the base type/numeric
type reference in Dr. Racket:  (1) Type Reference (1.1) Base Types. Given the
list provided in the reference, Natural falls right before the Negative-Integer.
I'll start by using Natural with this problem.

*NOTE*: you should have started by referring to the HtDW recipe to follow the
steps there, however, you started with the data definitions. This isn't the end
of the world because the order you executed was only one step off, i.e. you
should have defined constants after sketching the program scenario. Identifying
constants (from my sketch) now.

OK, I'm at a point where I'm not 100% sure what the next best step is *and* it's
almost the end of my study time. I do know this: I should read section 2.4 in
the help.  It explains "Worlds and the Universe".  Section 2.4.4.1 has a good
example of a state machine using a door as an example.

Signing-off at 0616, doing my Git commit, and making some oatmeal.

**===== 10/2 morning session; start @ 0448, finish @ 0627**

Up early. You MUST change now. You are showing your pattern again. This is the 
time that you MUST get through, so do it.

Your first thought when looking at the data definition problem was that there's
a trick question here because it looks too simple.

The tricky part comes at the Signature, i.e. Trip Trip -> Trip

You're supposed to compare two trips and return the trip with the longest
duration.

Done with the trip solution at 0536, roughly 45 minutes. It's worth noting that
although you didn't grasp the syntax & structure of the 'if' statement right
away, you did implement it without too much trouble. Here it is for reference:

(define (longer-trip t1 t2)
  (if (> (trip-duration t1) (trip-duration t2))
         t1
         t2))
         
It's also worth noting that the Prof. mentions on the HtDD page for compounds
that it's often useful to have numerous examples. In this trip problem I had
three and it saved me from typing out the 'make-trip' with all of the needed
parameters for each check-expect. It also made it easier to run the program,
i.e. (longer-trip T1 T2).

Starting the next problem (after a short break) at 0557; the rest of the
problems involve HtDW.

Starting tracker.rkt, a HtDW program that displays the current mouse (x,y).

Watched Prof. at 22mins in the third lecture (because of notes in notebook)
where he speaks of helper functions and he clarifies that each function should
perform only one (1) task. He exhorts us to look out for places to use 
separate functions.

A better study day, but you still need to work the junk out of your habits and
attitude. You're also feeling a bit intimidated by the programs you'll need to
solve, but as the Prof. mentioned, it's critical to get a grasp on designing
worlds well in order to complete the exercises that are coming in the weeks to
follow.

**===== 10/26 evening session; start @ 2200, finish @ 2230 =====**

World Series is on. Boston losing 2-1 in the top of the 6th.

Look at the problem B definition. It implies, I think, the use of an *and*
statment, i.e. "if the student has allergies *and* is in a qualifying grade,
their name should be added to a special list."

Overall it went OK your second time around, however, you were tempted to do the
following when writing the function:

(define (add-student? s)
  (and (<= (student-grade s) 6)
         (student-allergies? s) true))
         
This is wrong. The 'true' doesn't belong on the last line -- it should be
deleted.

The problems coming-up this week look formidable. You're still in a bit of a
lazy mood with regard to coding. Hang in there and press onward!

**===== 10/25 evening session; start @ 2105, finish @ 2135 =====**

Hooray! You're off of your lazy butt and you're working on CS like your said you
would!

Trying the student compound data definition problem. The "grade" is throwing me
off a bit because I wanted to put grade[1, 12] in the structure definition, but
it doesn't belong here.

When you got to the examples section of the HtDD template you weren't sure how
to create a good example, i.e. you forgot about the need for make-student.

Just starting the function now and my brain is getting hazy. Take a break.

**===== 10/25 morning session; start @ 0510, finish @ 0617 =====**

Started by reviewing cowabunga code in the steps laid out by the Prof. Getting
back to student problem; working on function definition.

Checked my data definition against the Prof's. I used Integer for the student
grade where the Prof. uses Natural[1, 12]. You have to remember this for bounded
lists like these student grades. You also forgot to capitalize the first letter
of your data definition for Student. You also forgot to add a "?" to your
boolean value for allergy, i.e. (student-allergy? s). And for some silly reason,
you cited the template rules used as a compound with *2* fields when it's 3.

When you started the HtDF, you first made the signature Student -> Student when
it's supposed to be Student -> Boolean.

During the function definition and check-expect remember that your function is a
boolean, so it's name needs to be add-student? Then, for the check-expect, you
need to use the make-student compound data definition, like so:

(check-expect (add-student? (make-student "Bob" 5 true)) true)

You were stuck and decided to not spend much time figuring out the actual
structure of the function. There is a need to use "and" to qualify the condition
needed for a student to be marked as being in the correct grade range *and*
having an allergy.

You really should write the program again without looking at anything so that
the structure and tools in it become more fixed in your thinking.

**===== 10/24 morning session; start @ 0625, finish @ 0705 =====**

Off today -- Dad's in town for lunch, hence the later start.

Don't forget to use the HtDD and HtDF template you created when working probs.

Got through data definition. MUST find time later today to complete this problem
and move on to another one.  Didn't make time -- bad dog.

**===== 10/23 morning session; start @ 0515, finish @ 0549 =====**

I have to leave for Randolph by 0645 so I'll have to adjust accordingly.

Have another look at 8:45 and on in the last video (cowabunga). You need to 
start working on some problems and get out of video watching mode.

**===== 10/22 morning session; start @ 0505, finish @ 0627 =====**

You just finished analyzing the traffic light solution from 0505 to 0542. Now
it's on to designing compound data definitions (to represent information that
consists of two or more naturally connected values).

Watching the three videos now. During the second video at 4:23 the Prof. talks
about how the data driven template for compound data definitions is interpreted.
Have a look at the example used in the HtDD page:

(define-struct ball (x y))
;; Ball is (make-ball Number Number)
;; interp. a ball at position x, y 

(define BALL-1 (make-ball 6 10))

#;
(define (fn-for-ball b)
  (... (ball-x b)     ;Number
       (ball-y b)))   ;Number
;; Template rules used:
;;  - compound: 2 fields

You'll only get through watching the first two videos this morning; the last
video is 30 minutes long and the cowabunga! problem will take awhile to really
digest. This topic also have a good number of exercises with it -- it seems
important that you gain a firm understanding of this. Look back and see how much
better you feel about your understanding of data definitions and functions after
making the 3+ week investment in doing the topics all over again, slowly and 
deliberately.

Press on! :-)
